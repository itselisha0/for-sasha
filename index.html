      <p>Sasha,</p>
      <p>There are moments in life when everything shifts—when the universe seems to align perfectly, and suddenly, you find yourself standing at the beginning of something special. For me, that moment was the day we started talking. You walked into my life so unexpectedly, yet from the very first second, it felt as though you had always been meant to be there. Words cannot even begin to capture how deeply grateful I am for you—for your presence, your kindness, your laughter, and the way you’ve changed me in ways I never thought possible.</p>

      <p>Before you came along, I didn’t know what it meant to truly feel seen or understood. But with you, it’s different. It’s like you look past all the walls that I’ve built up over time, and see straight through to who I am. And somehow, you still choose to stay. That alone is enough to leave me breathless. How did I get so lucky? How did someone as incredible as you decide to share even a piece of your world with me?</p>

      <p>If I could relive any moment in my life, it would be the days where we are together—the ones that seem almost surreal now, like they were plucked straight out of a dream. Every laugh, every conversation, every quiet glance between us—it all felt so magical, so perfect. They showed me what it means to connect with another person on such a deep level that it feels like nothing else in the world matters anymore.</p>

      <p>But if I’m being honest, there’s always one moment that haunts me: The last night before I leave for school again. I think about those often—the long hours where we talked and talked and where we cried in each other’s arms, caught somewhere between saying goodbye and wishing we didn’t have to. However, I truly believe that everything happens for a reason—and maybe this is just our story unfolding in its own time.</p>

      <p>You might be surprised that I’ve done all of this just for you, but honestly, it’s still not enough. No amount of words could ever fully express how much you mean to me. You’ve become such an important part of my life, Sasha—a light in my darkest days, a source of strength when I need it most, and a reminder that love can exist in its purest form in this generation. Even though we’re apart right now, please know that distance doesn’t diminish what we share. In fact, it only makes my heart grow fonder. Every day without you feels incomplete, but knowing that you’re out there—thinking of me, loving me in your own way—is enough to keep me going.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I wonder if you realize just how extraordinary you are. Do you know how your smile lights up a room? Or how your laugh has the power to heal even the heaviest of hearts? Or the way your eyes twinkle like the stars in the night sky? Do you understand how your presence alone can turn an ordinary moment into something unforgettable? You have this rare ability to make people feel loved and valued, and I consider myself endlessly fortunate to be one of those people.</p>

      <p>I want you to know that no matter where life takes us, no matter how far apart we may be physically, I will always be here for you. Always (haha get it). Whether it’s celebrating your victories, comforting you in times of sadness, or simply being with you in silence, I promise to stand by your side through it all. Loving you isn’t something I take lightly. It’s something I carry in my heart with pride, gratitude, and unwavering devotion.</p>

      <p>Even though it hurts and it’s sad, I think there is truly something beautiful in our relationship waiting to blossom. Even through all our arguments—our conflicts and our disagreements—we still choose each other every day. Although there are moments of uncertainty, I want you to know that I will always be here for you—I will always choose you every second of the day because I love you. I know that we are very different people, but they always say that opposites attract. Maybe we are the epitome of this. I believe that through our relationship that we will persevere and we will grow together to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be for the world and for each other. Every waking moment in my life I look forward to the day where we can be together again. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. I really believe in this saying. Do you know why? Because we have experienced it already, and we will continue to experience it. Who knows (get it) how long it will take, but if we fight through it all… WHEN we push through it all, I truly believe that the end result will be something beautiful.</p>

      <p>Sasha, you’ve shown me what it means to truly love and be loved. You’ve taught me that vulnerability isn’t weakness—it’s courage. You’ve reminded me that connection is worth fighting for, no matter how daunting the journey may seem. And because of you, I’ve learned to dream bigger, love harder, and believe in possibilities I once thought were out of reach.</p>

      <p>So thank you. Thank you for being here for me. Thank you for choosing me no matter how difficult I may be. Thank you for showing up in my life when I least expected it but needed it most. Thank you for trusting me, inspiring me, and giving me hope for a future filled with endless moments together. My only hope is that someday, somehow, I can show you just how much you’ve impacted mine.</p>

      <p>Until then, please remember this: you are loved. Deeply, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly. By me. Forever.</p>

      <p>I have one question to ask you:</p>

      <p>Could I have the honor of being your Valentine?</p>

      <p>Yours always and completely,</p>
